title: Hello world

This is not the first time I start a new home page, but I hope it will be the last!

I have many thoughts, scattered. I have had many projects, some of which I finished.

I am having an itching sense of that it is time to *do* something. To gather these thoughts. To find a worthy target, and see if I can make a dent in it.

This has driven me to repeatedly try gathering my thoughts and what I have done so far.

My hope is that this will help me clearer see what comes next. What I can do beyond where I am now.

For now, this page will be fragmented, because that is how I do my "overview-thinking". Then I gradually refine, circling into the target. So bear with me, if you wish.

Don't hestitate to reach out! At the moment, ![LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakobwillforss) is probably the best place to find me.
